You’ve built something genuinely useful and polished, and you’re definitely on the right track with the Hydroponics CO₂ Flow Estimator. Let’s break down what’s correct, what might need a check, and where to go next in terms of functionality and UX evolution.

✅ Core Calculator Logic – Are the Calculations Correct?
🎯 Your Scenario Input:
Room Volume: 4.1m × 3m × 2.4m = 29.52 m³

Target CO₂ Level: 1000 ppm (typical for early flower)

Daily Usage: 12 hours/day, 7 days/week

💡 Expected Calculation Breakdown
🧮 1. CO₂ Needed to Reach 1000 ppm
We use the conversion:

1 ppm CO₂ per m³ = 1.8 mg

So for 1000 ppm:

Edit
CO₂ needed (grams) = 29.5 m³ × 1000 ppm × 1.8 mg
                   = 53,100 mg
                   = 53.1 g (if this is full enrichment at once)
However, your tool shows:

Daily CO₂: 27 g

That suggests you're calculating a partial or phased enrichment, or accounting for natural CO₂ levels (~400 ppm) already present. If you’re only adding 600 ppm, then:

Edit
29.5 × 600 × 1.8 = 31.86 g
Which makes sense if you're enriching from ambient 400 → 1000 ppm. Your output of 27g may factor in:

some natural CO₂ contribution,

safety margin,

or estimated CO₂ retention in a sealed room.

📌 Conclusion: Your calc logic is roughly in the ballpark, though a tooltip should clarify if it’s assuming partial top-up vs full ppm target. I can help you refine that formula with deeper gas law application if you want.

🚀 UI/UX: What to Improve or Add
Here’s a modern + helpful roadmap based on what real growers & SEO love:

🌱 UI Additions
Feature	Why It Matters
✅ Tooltip next to “Target CO₂ Level”	Explain typical values for veg, flower, etc.
✅ “Assumes CO₂ enrichment from 400ppm ambient” text	Clarify the grams calc logic
✅ Cylinder Comparison Output in £/week	Adds ROI layer
✅ Flow Rate toggle g/hr ↔ L/min	Unit conversion (ideal for some regulator specs)
✅ Auto-highlight cylinder choice	Highlight 6kg, 10kg, or 20kg based on weekly usage
✅ “CO₂ Leak?” quick test	Add soapy water tip + image
✅ CO₂ Schedule Export	iCal or .csv export with hourly dosing suggestion

📈 Smart Functional Additions
Regulator Calculator:

Users enter their regulator’s flow in L/min, get time-to-empty.

CO₂ “Top-Up Alert” Generator:

Email prompt: “Time to reorder!” based on their weekly rate.

Room Leak Simulator (Beta):

Ask: “How fast does your ppm drop?” → Estimate leak rate or room sealing needs.
