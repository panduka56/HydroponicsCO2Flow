🌱 Hydroponics CO₂ Flow Estimator – Full Concept
🔧 Purpose
A free, browser-based calculator that helps indoor growers determine:

Ideal CO₂ ppm levels based on grow room dimensions

CO₂ release rate in L/min or g/hr

Cylinder size needed per week/month

Recommended regulator settings

Safety tips and usage best practices

🧮 Key Inputs (User Form Fields)
Field	Type	Purpose
Room Length (m)	Number Input	Dimension for volume calc
Room Width (m)	Number Input	Dimension for volume calc
Room Height (m)	Number Input	Dimension for volume calc
Target CO₂ Level (ppm)	Dropdown (400-1500 ppm)	Defines enrichment level
Hours of Enrichment	Number Input (per day)	Adjusts for light cycles
Days per Week	Number Input	Frequency of use
Ventilation Type	Dropdown (Sealed/Exhausting)	Affects CO₂ retention
Cylinder Type	Dropdown (6kg, 10kg, 20kg)	Used for output comparison

📈 Outputs
Output	Description
Room Volume (m³)	Auto-calculated
Daily CO₂ Needed (g or L)	Based on volume and target ppm
Total Weekly Usage	For cylinder planning
Suggested Cylinder Size	Based on frequency
Recommended Regulator Flow Rate	g/hr or L/min
Duration Each Cylinder Will Last	ROI driver
Safety Guidance	Inline notes & expandable FAQs

🛠️ How It Works (Backend Logic Overview)
Volume Calculation
Volume (m³) = Length × Width × Height

CO₂ Requirement Calculation
Using standard enrichment formula:
CO₂ grams = Volume (m³) × Target PPM × 0.0018

Adjustment for Time
If CO₂ is used only during lighting (e.g., 12hr/day), adjust consumption accordingly.

Cylinder Comparison Logic
6kg = ~3000L CO₂
10kg = ~5000L CO₂
20kg = ~10000L CO₂
Estimate duration by dividing weekly CO₂ use by bottle capacity.
